Redmile Project
===============

This is a generated 'Redmile' YAML project file. It contains:
- project metadata
- members
- milestones
- issue templates
- example issues

How to use:
- Edit /mnt/data/Redmile.yaml to update fields.
- Import to your tool (or adapt to Redmine/other PM tool if needed).

If you meant 'Redmine' (the popular project management app), tell me and I will convert this into a Redmine-compatible CSV or provide import instructions. See: https://www.redmine.org/ for Redmine details.
